## Other Tipps
[Compiler Explorer (godbolt)](https://godbolt.org/z/PjP4r1GqP) is an amazing Website with which you can discover how different compilers translate code to machine instructions.

When compiling code generated with flex and `-Wall` you will get warnings that `input` and `yyunput` is unused. By adding the following lines to the top of the file you can fix those warnings.
```
%option noinput
%option nounput
```

There are two great videos on YouTube for an overview of [flex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpVufkH4gog&list=PLImMVrOC3KFn0US0AiW0JYLaU8mCtrqG0&index=7) and [bison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFRxWtRibC8&list=PLImMVrOC3KFn0US0AiW0JYLaU8mCtrqG0&index=13).

On [VoWi Ãœbersetzterbau](https://vowi.fsinf.at/wiki/TU_Wien:%C3%9Cbersetzerbau_VU_(Ertl,_Krall)) are some solutions from past semesters which can be very helpfull in understanding, and learning from practial examples.
